Key Components of a Search Engine
Web Crawlers:
These are automated programs that browse the internet systematically to discover and index new web pages. They follow links from one page to another, gathering data about content.

Indexing:
After crawling, the data collected is stored in an index. This index is like a giant database where all the information is organized and categorized for quick retrieval.

Search Algorithm:
When you type a query, the search engine uses complex algorithms to determine which results are most relevant. The algorithms analyze factors like:

Keywords in the content.
Website authority and backlinks.
User intent and location.
Freshness of the content.
Ranking:
Results are ranked based on relevance to the query. Search engines like Google use ranking factors like quality, credibility, and user experience to order the results.

User Interface:
The interface displays the search results, often as a list of web pages, images, videos, or other types of content, based on your query.
